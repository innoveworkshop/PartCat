Electronic components cataloger and organizer application.

![Application Screenshot](/screenshots/2019-05-01.png?raw=true)

## How it Works

This application uses a very simple directory and file based approach to store
its files, no databases involved. This way you can easily move your library
around, sync it between computers, and even place your whole library inside a
Git (or whatever you prefer) repository and manage it that way.

## Installation

Well, you can always just run the `PartCat.jar` file located inside `dist/`, but
if you're running Linux you can go to the `dist/` directory and run the
`install.sh` script there to automatically create system-wide files and make
things easier on you.
